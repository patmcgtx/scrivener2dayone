# scrivener2dayone
A shell script to convert [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) project files to [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com))-ready test files.  

Tested and works on macOS (requires shell access).

## 👉 But why?

Always a good question: *why*.  Why would I want to convert Scrivener to DayOne?

I had a writing project in Scrivener that I decided I wanted to move to DayOne to simplify my writing process.  As it turns out, I had **506 entries** in Scriviner.  When I though about convering those manually, I cried one tear and nearly abandonded the project. 🤦🏻‍♂️

And then I decided to dust off the ol' shell scripting skills 👨🏻‍💻 and automate this tedious process.  That's that computers are for, right?

Admittedly, this is a pretty specific case and likely only useful to me, but I thought I'd toss it out into the world just in case someone else is in the same boat. 🚤

## How to use

- [ ] Add details / screenshots for each step

It's a semi-automated process.

1. Export your project from Scriviner for macOS as .txt files
2. Run this script on the exported Scriviner files to convert them a DayOne-importable format
3. Import the converted files into DayOne through the DayOne macOS client
4. Tag and edit in DayOne as needed
